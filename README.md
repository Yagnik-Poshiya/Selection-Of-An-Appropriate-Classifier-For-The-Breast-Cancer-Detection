# Selection Of An Appropriate Classifier For The Breast Cancer Detection
This repository contains small-medium sizes datasets namely **WDBC Original, WDBC Diagnostic and CBIS-DDSM** in the numerical format. And it also contains machine learning code for the breast cancer detection from csv data.
Here There are three CSV files provided 
  1. WDBC-ORIGINAL
  2. WDBCDiagnosticDataset
  3. Train-TestMergedCalcification

Where WDBC-ORIGINAL is for WDBC(original) dataset and related ipynb file is **"WDBC_Original_BreastCancerDetection_Using_Machine_Learning"**. WDBCDiagnosticDataset is for WDBC Diagnostic dataset and related ipynb file is **"WDBC_Diagnostic_BreastCancerDetection_Using_Machine_Learning"** and Train-TestMergedCalcification is for CBIS-DDSM dataset and related ipynb file is **"CBIS_DDSM_BCD_Using_Machine_Learning"**.
In ipynb file you can find detailed description of dataset. And short description like total number instances, total number of instaces based on category etc. information is provided in **Images** folder under **dataset description** title.

And whole flow of execution of this code is given in also **Images** folder under title **Flow Of Execution**. and at last ***Comparison Table*** is given in **Images** folder under title **Comparison Table**.
